My minimal personal page and blog built with Astro, Tailwind and Typescript. I made it on top of astro-nano

TO DO:🥷🏿
- [ ] Rebuild design, change fonts and play around the colour themes.
- [ ] Add logo, favikon and change some text based hyperlinks in to icons (github,li,x etc)
- [ ] Think about some cringe stuff you can build around the page
- [x] fix CSS and content
- [x] Change domain to  ~~wujs.io~~ wujs.xyz
